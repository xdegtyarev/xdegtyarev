My name is Alexander Degtyarev. I‚Äôve been in the industry for 13+ years, mostly doing mobile, PC and console games, but also spent some time working on computer vision, machine learning, industrial simulations and synthetic data generation. While dealing with a large variety of real-time 3D applications, I learned a lot about platform-specific and general performance optimizations, graphics programming, building custom tools, setting up pipelines for artists, designing and building large complex solutions from scratch, supporting LiveOps projects and starting new.
